11/7 Staring to look over project and develpning a erly todo list

11/10 attempted to make classes Main managerimp as a implementation of EscapeGameManager and CoordinatTypeSquare from Coordinate as practice to understand how the dependencies may work.
Created XYCoordinate as a interface to used in conjunction with Coordinate to find the X, Y and disnance with other Coordinates.
Set up EscapeGameBuilderTest tests
Created a Escape.Square package to hold all programs used sole  for  square board

11/11 add moveToCoordinate to  XYCoordinate interface.  added to the inializer methethod in PieceAttribute.

11/12 add description to PieceAttribute, MovementPattern, PieceName, and PieceAttributeID.
 added to the inializer methethod for PieceTypeDescriptor.
 Create Game board Interface to base board creation on.
 
 11/13 using Hashmaps in MakeSquareBoard to hold Pieces and  Locations made for board.
 made  inializer for MakeSquareBoard. makeCoordinate for square board. 
 made makeEscapePiece and makeLocation for GameBoard
 
 11/14 create makeEscapePiece for  MakeSquareBoard, changed PieceMap to use PieceTypeDescriptor instead of EscapePiece.
 
 11/15 made PieceTypeDescriptor a implementaion of EscapePiece so GameBoard can use getPieceAt(). 
take a PieceTypeDescriptor as agrument for makeEscapePiece instead  making a new EscapePiece in GameBoard

11/16 overhall program, adding EscapePiecelmpl, implement EscapeGameBuilder, 
Created AphaTest.

11/17 reorder packages,  
create CoordinateFactory, 
changed makeSquareboard to EscapeBoard, 
finish EscapePiecelmpl.
implement move in EscapeBoard

11/18
Create Exception classes for Coordinate, Board, and EscapeGameIlitializationException
Created TestBoardParts and TestSquareCoordinates
Fix error in putPieceAt in EscapeBoard.
merge makeLocation into setLocationType.

11/19 Add more Test cases to test more parts of code
added equals and hashCode in EscapeCoordinate to solve probelm of Hashmap not reconizing EscapeCoordinate inpute.

11/23 Create todolist for Bata, Rearange classes into proper packages
11/24 add pieces and attribues to EscapeGameBuilder
11/25 Modify EscapePieiceimpl to take and get PiecetypeDesciptor, then Test change.
make a isNearCluster method to return all nabores for a coordinate
start make method to find shortest path.

11/26 for EscapeGameBuilder greateed a class PieceTypeDescriptorArray to hold and get inilaize rules for particulare pieces
11/28 Create class to throw error if the movmentPatter of a piece is not compatable with board type.
11/30 Implemnt method pathClear and helper methods checkLine, CanMoveThrough and AtPieceMovesEnd in Game Board to help find
